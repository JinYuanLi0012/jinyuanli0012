## About Me

I am a second-year master's student at [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm), under the mentorship of Prof. [Gang Pan](https://gpantju.github.io/index/). Previously, I worked as a research intern at [Baidu](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/en) and explored multimodal document understanding. My enthusiasm lies in exploring multimodal machine learning and my recent endeavors revolve around unleashing the latent capabilities of vision-language models within intricate multimodal tasks. The ultimate goal of my research is to explore multimodal foundational models with higher levels of visual and language intelligence.



## Research Interests

- **Natural Language Processing:** Large Vision-Language Model Fundation and Application, Multimodal Information Extraction
- **Computer Vision:** Open-world Visual Intelligence, Image Inpainting and Synthesis

## NewsðŸ”¥

- **[Jun. 2024]** We release a [new study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07268) proposing the Segmented Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (SMNER) task and constructing the corresponding Twitter-SMNER dataset. Datasets and Code will be released at [here](https://github.com/JinYuanLi0012/RiVEG).
- **[May. 2024]** One paper is accepted to [ACL 2024](https://2024.aclweb.org/). See you in Bangkok!
- **[Apr. 2024]** Delighted to be onboard at Baidu as a research intern.
- **[Feb. 2024]** A new research about Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) and Large Language Models has been released! see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09989).
- **[Oct. 2023]** One paper about Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) is accepted to [EMNLP 2023](https://2023.emnlp.org/).

## Others
When Iâ€™m not in research mode, I enjoy swimming and violin. They have been with me for nearly twenty years. My favorite virtuoso is Ray Chen. Hope to hear his concert in Beijing in August.
