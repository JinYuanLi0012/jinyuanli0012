## About Me

I am a final-year master's student at [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm), under the mentorship of Prof. [Gang Pan](https://gpantju.github.io/index/). Previously, I worked as a research intern at [Baidu](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/en) and explored multimodal document understanding. I am also fortunate to be under the guidance of Prof. [Jianfei Yu](https://sites.google.com/site/jfyu1990/). My enthusiasm lies in exploring Multimodal Learning, Vision and Language. And my recent endeavors revolve around unleashing the latent capabilities of vision-language models within intricate multimodal tasks. The ultimate goal of my research is to explore the multimodal system with higher levels of visual and language intelligence. 

I'm open to collaboration and discussions. Please feel free to contact me and explore possibilities together.


## Research Interests

- **Natural Language Processing:** Vision-Language Model Fundation and Application, Multimodal Information Extraction

## Miscellaneous
When Iâ€™m not in research mode, I enjoy swimming (Swim one kilometer freestyle in less than 18 minutes) and violin (Fluent sight-reading skills). They have been with me for nearly twenty years. My favorite virtuoso is Ray Chen. His interpretation of the music always carries a distinct personal touch. I hope I can approach my research in the same way.

In the past, I demonstrated strong road cycling capabilities, maintaining a speed of 36 km/h for three hours. Additionally, I found being an anchor very engaging.

To the very best of times.
